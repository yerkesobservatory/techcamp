COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS
========================

This is a list of variables that are sent over socket. Add to this document as more data is sent over socket.

Flask -> Output
---------------

Motor Communication:
"m# ### ###" //m(Motor number 1-4) (Motor power -255 255 Must be 3 digits) (Motor Time, 0 for infinite)
Servo Communication:
"s# (0 - 100) // servo number, direction from 0 to 100

Led Communication:
"led# #" //The second # indicates the power of led upto 255; Example: led1 255 // Led1 is at full power

Flask -> InCam
--------------

Image Communication:
"color #" //take color image; #=alpha of image

Flask <-> Sensor
----------------

Sensor Communication:
" 'Sensor Name' " // Sensor name will change based on sensors available. This
                     command will send back the reading of the sensor at that time.
                     
Active Sensors:
  time : returns time data was last taken in HH:MM:SS format
  test : a test variable which is constant
  dist1, dist2, dist3: distance sensors (not all may be available)
  head, pitch, roll: attitude control results
