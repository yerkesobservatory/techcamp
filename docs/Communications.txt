COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS
========================

This is a list of variables that are sent over socket. Add to this document as more data is sent over socket.

Flask -> Output
---------------

Motor Communication:
"mp# (-255 - 255) //-#: motor backward at #% power; 0: stop motor; #: motor forward at #% power
"mt# (-1 / 1) time //-#: motor run forward / backward for time

Servo Communication:
"s# (0 - 100) // servo number, direction from 0 to 100

Led Communication:
"led# #" //The second # indicates the power of led upto 255; Example: led1 255 // Led1 is at full power

Flask -> InCam
--------------

Image Communication:
"color #" //take color image; #=alpha of image

Flask <-> Sensor
----------------

Sensor Communication:
" 'Sensor Name' " // Sensor name will change based on sensors available. This
                     command will send back the reading of the sensor at that time.
